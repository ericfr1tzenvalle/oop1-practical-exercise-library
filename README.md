# OOP1 - Practical Exercise: Library System

This project is part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP1) course. It demonstrates the basic principles of object-oriented design by creating a simple library management system using Java.

## Description

The system includes classes that model a library and its components:

- **Book**: Represents a book in the library.
- **Publisher**: Represents the publisher of the book.
- **PhysicalBook**: Inherits from `Book` and represents a physical book.
- **Ebook**: Inherits from `Book` and represents an electronic version of a book.
- **Library**: Manages the collection of books and allows searching, adding, and removing books.

The purpose of this project is to practice fundamental OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Features

- Create and manage books (physical and e-books).
- Add and remove books from the library.
- Search for books by title or author.
- Model relationships between books and publishers.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
