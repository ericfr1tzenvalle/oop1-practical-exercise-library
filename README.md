📚 OOP1 - Practical Exercise: Library System
This project is part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP1) course. It demonstrates basic OOP principles by implementing a simple library management system in Java.

🧠 Description

Book – Base class for all books.

Publisher – Represents the publisher of a book.

PhysicalBook – Inherits from Book; represents a physical book.

Library – Manages a collection of books and provides search functionality.

The project reinforces key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
